# Minesweeper as a Command Line Interface
Minesweeper_cli it's a project that I developed years ago (october 2011) in C. I was basically in high school in Italy and started a simple hobby project: realising a simple minesweeper using C that was usable with the linux terminal.

## How to compile:
`gcc -o minesweeper.out main.c`
## How to run:
`./minesweeper`
